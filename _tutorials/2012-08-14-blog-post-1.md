# Steps to create a minimal Github website:

If you are bored to read the long tutorial from [https://academicpages.github.io/](https://academicpages.github.io/), here is a quick summary steps and a minimal example file to open a minimal academic website. All we need is a Github account and an interface ([Github Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), or anything you like).

0. **(Optional) Register:** Register a Github account at <https://github.com/signup>. Download an interface [Github Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

1.  **(Crucial) Create the repository:** Create a new repository at <https://github.com/new>. Name it EXACTLY as \<yourGithubUsername\>.github.io (e.g., I named it dawranadeep.github.io).

2.  **Clone:** Clone (download) it locally. I suggest you use the interfaces, but if you are comfortable with Git functionalities via terminal, do the following:

    0.  Ensure Git is installed, or see <https://github.com/git-guides/install-git>.

    1.  In the local machine, at the intended project location, open a terminal/command prompt.

    2.  Clone it using:

    ``` console
    git clone <https://github.com>/<yourGithubUsername>/<yourGithubUsername>.github.io
    ```

3.  **Create main.html file** In the minimal setup, Github hosts the "main.html" file at the root directory. A minimal html file can use the following code:


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title> Ranadeep Daw </title>
  <style>
    body {
      font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
      margin: 2rem;
    }
    h1 {
      font-size: 2rem;
    }
    h2 {
      font-size: 1.5rem;
      margin-top: 1rem;
    }
    p {
      line-height: 1.5;
    }
    a {
      color: #007bff;
    }
    .blog-post {
      margin-bottom: 2rem;
      border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;
      padding-bottom: 1rem;
    }
    .blog-post-title {
      font-weight: bold;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>  
  <h1> Ranadeep Daw </h1>
  <h2> Website </h2>
  <hr>
  <p> Minimal website to post stuff. </p>
  <section>
    <h2> Research Interests </h2>
    <p> Spatial statistics, modeling, individual outcome model, some basic machine learning techniques. </p>
  </section>
  
</body>
</html>
```
   
4.  **Push (upload) to Github:** Again, I suggest to use the interface. If you're comfortable with terminal, use the following code:

``` console
git add .
git commit -m "<some message>"
git push
```

5.  See updated website at \<yourGithubUsername\>.github.io



Note, changes are immediate, but not real time. Give it a couple of minutes before seeing the reflected changes.
