Class Style
======
Primarily use Canvas to share my classnotes. Additional notes in the class are also subsequently e-typed and shared via Canvas. I use 6-8 homeworks assignments including some programming implementations.

I try to teach hands-on data analysis with $\texttt{R}$ and documentation of results in a report.
