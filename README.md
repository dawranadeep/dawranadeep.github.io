# Academic Pages

I created this website follwing the template from [Academic Pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). Academic Pages is a Github Pages template for academic websites. Their instruction manual can be found [here](https://academicpages.github.io/). Another detailed tutorial that helped me a lot is available from Rob William's [homepage](https://jayrobwilliams.com/posts/2020/06/academic-website/).
