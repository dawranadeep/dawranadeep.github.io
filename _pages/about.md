I am currently waiting to join the University of West Florida as an Assistant Professor of Statistics starting Fall 2024. 

Past Experiences
======
I hold a Bachelor's (2014) and Master's (2016) degree in Statistics from the **Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata**. I did my Ph.D. in Statistics from the **University of Missouri Columbia** in the May, 2023. 

I worked as a postdoc at the **National Institute
of Health** at the [Spatiotemporal Exposure and Toxicology](https://niehs.github.io/SET/) group between 2023-24. In industry, I have worked at **Deloitte** between 2016-17 as a Data Scientist. I also did internships at the **Missouri Division of Conservation, General Electric**, and **FinIQ**.


Research Interest
======
Spatial data, spatiotemporal methods, random neural learning, computational statistics, tools development. Open to learn and collaborate in Biostatistics.


Current Research
======
1. **Orthonormal spatial basis functions**. A Github repository of code and manuscript will come soon.
2. **CAGE.jl.** Julia package of basis functions, Karhunen-Loeve, and CAGE. Follows the theory from the [CAGE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.01974) and the [Multivariate CAGE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.12287) idea.


Teaching Responsibility
======
I will be teaching Biostatistics (STA4173) for the Fall 2024. A Github repository will be shared once the course starts.
